7. Push commit
8. Create a new branch from master and name it 'develop' 
9. Repeat tasks 5-7 in the new develop branch (try giving commits other names) 
10. Return (checkout) to the master branch and create another branch with name 'fix' 
11. Repeat tasks 5-7 in the new *fix* branch, but before push create 2 commits except 1 
12. Return (checkout) to the *develop* branch and merge *fix* branch to this branch
