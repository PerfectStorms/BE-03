# Introduction to Data Types

## Homework

### 1. Task for the byte data type:
   Write a fragment of the class (group of commands) that will assign 
   the first value: ​​127, and the second: 255, 
   and then the third variable will receive a value 
   equal to the substraction of the values ​​of the two variables.
    
    An example of the class name for this assignment is presented below:   
```java
    public class ProgramTask31 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
// Write down here (in the comment to the program) how many 
// values ​​the byte data type stores and how much memory it takes.
        }
    }
```  
### 2. Task for the short data type:
   Write a fragment of the class (group of commands) that will assign 
   the values ​​-32768 and 32768 to two variables, 
   and then the third variable will receive a value 
   equal to the sum of the values ​​of the two variables.
    
    An example of the class name for this assignment is presented below:   
```java
        public class ProgramTask32 {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
// Write down here (in the comment to the program) how many 
// values ​​the short data type stores and how much memory it takes.
            }
        }
```    
### 3. Task for the int data type:
    
   Write a class that assigns the value 1200 to x, and then displays: 
   in the first line: this value; 
   in the second line: the square of this value; 
   in the third line: the cube of this value.
    
    An example of the class name for this assignment is presented below:   
```java
        public class ProgramTask33 {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
// Write down here (in the comment to the program) how many 
// values ​​the int data type stores and how much memory it takes.
            }
        }
```    
### 4. Task for the long data type:
    
   Print to the console the maximum value that can be of type long.
   Answer the question, where such a huge value can be used?
    
    An example of the class name for this assignment is presented below:   
```java
        public class ProgramTask34 {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
// Write down here the answer to the question.
            }
        }
```    
### 5. Task for the float and double data types:
   Given a floating-point number "A", which stores 1245.554 kilograms of apples and a double number "B", 
   stores 256.3785 kilograms of apples.
   Print the fractional part of the multiplication of these two numbers.
    
    An example of the class name for this assignment is presented below:   
```java
    public class ProgramTask35 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
// Write down here (in the comment to the program) how many 
// values ​​the float, double data type store and how much memory it take.
        }
    }
```  
### 6. Task for the char data types:
   Write a class which displays the character in the first line
   “+”, In the second - the sign “!”, In the third - the sign “?”.
    
    An example of the class name for this assignment is presented below:   
```java
    public class ProgramTask36 {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
// Write down here (in the comment to the program) how many 
// values ​​the char data type store and how much memory it take.
        }
    }
``` 
### 7. Task for all data types:
