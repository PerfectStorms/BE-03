# Introduction to Generalized types.

## Homework

### 1. Parameterized Class
Create a parameterized class with 3 different types having variables and method, 
then create 3 different objects of this class which invoke the method. 

### 2. Parameterized Method
Create a parameterized method which allows to fill any collection type List with 
default value.
For example, all values in the collection List<String> lists must be "Hello". 

### 3. Wildcards
Create multiple methods with wildcards and bounded wildcards and demonstrates their work.

### 4. Questions
1. How do you understand why we use ***Generics***?
2. What is wildcards?
3. Name the types of bounded wildcards and explain the difference between them.
