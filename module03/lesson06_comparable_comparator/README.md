# Introduction to Interfaces Comparable and Comparator.

## Homework

### 1.

Create a Car class with fields model (String), speed (int).
Implement interface Comparable, 
which sorts by field the speed in ascending order.

### 2
Sort the collection of these objects.
Display the result on the screen.

### 3.

Create a Comparator for sort the objects by the models field (descending).
Sort the collection of these objects use Comparator.
Display it.

### 4.

Create a Comparator that will sort by model (ascending) and speed (descending).
Note:
If model matches, then sorts by speed.

Example:
Audi 250, Audi 210, BMW 253 ...

### 5. Questions
1. What is Comparable?
2. What is Comparator?
3. What the compare () and compareTo () methods return. How it works?
4. When is a comparator preferred?
5. Can comparator be used when Comparable is already implemented?
6. What does the method for sorting the collection look like?
7. Do I need to implement Comparable for strings and numbers? Why?
