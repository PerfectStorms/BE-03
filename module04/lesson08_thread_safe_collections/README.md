# Thread safe collections

## Homework

### Questions:
1. What collection implementations, besides queues, the java.util.concurrent provides for use in multithreaded contexts?
2. What do all change operations (add, set, remove) lead to in CopyOnWrite collections?
3. Which collection from the java.util.concurrent is analogous to TreeMap with multithreading support?
4. When is CopyOnWriteArrayList preferred over synchronized Array List?
5. When is it preferable to use "concurrent" versions of collections, and when are unsynchronized collections, and when are "Synchronized" classes?
